============
Comment:
This example mainly was used to illustrate how one box can push two boxes at the time.
We were not given the result, but we were given how the map looks at the end of the movements:

##############
##...[].##..##
##...@.[]...##
##....[]....##
##..........##
##..........##
##############

So we have three boxes:
 ROW   COL
  1     5
  2     7
  3     6

So that's going to be (1 + 2 + 3) * 100 + (5 + 7 + 6) = 600 + 18 = 618
