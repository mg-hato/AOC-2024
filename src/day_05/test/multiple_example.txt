1|3
2|3

1,2,4
3,2,1

##########
in this example we have simpler case, 1 and 2 need to be before 3
For part 1: [1,2,4] is correctly ordered (i.e. it does not violate any rule)

For part 2, we have a problem that we do not know how to put 1 and 2, certainly 3 goes last,
but is it [1,2,3] or [2,1,3]. Both are correct, but the middle number has changed this way.
