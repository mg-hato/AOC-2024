in this example effectively we have a penthagon shaped relationship.
1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, ... , 5 goes back to 1.
Naturally, this is very cyclical.

For part 1: [1,2,4] and [3,5,1] is correctly ordered (i.e. it does not violate any rule)

For part 2, we clearly have an issue that forming DAG would not work (because it is not acyclical, not a DAG).
So we expect that error to be reported
